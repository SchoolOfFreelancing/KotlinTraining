**Project Description**: The hands-on project can vary based on participants' interests and the complexity you want to introduce. Here's an example project:

**Project: Simple To-Do List Application**

Participants will build a command-line to-do list application using Kotlin. The project will cover:

- Creating a data structure to represent tasks.
- Implementing features like adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- Saving tasks to a file and loading them when the program starts.
- Interactive user interface with menu options.
- Exception handling for user input errors.
- Testing and refining the application.

Throughout the project, participants will apply the Kotlin concepts they've learned in the training module.

**Hands-On Exercises**: Include hands-on coding exercises and mini-projects at the end of each day's session to reinforce the topics covered that day.

**Assessment**: Optionally, you can assess participants based on their project completion and understanding of Kotlin concepts.

By incorporating a hands-on project into your Kotlin training module, participants will gain practical experience and confidence in their Kotlin programming skills. The project can be adapted to different skill levels, and participants can take their completed project as a tangible outcome of the training.
